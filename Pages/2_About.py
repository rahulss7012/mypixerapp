st.write("""Image manipulation is necessary in todayâ€™s technological world. The list of uses
is endless, ranging from picture editing for personal use to producing site design
and graphic design for businesses. For picture editing, retouching, building image
compositions, making website mockups, and adding effects, there are several tools
and apps on the market. However, the majority of the more sophisticated functions in
their applications need a paid membership, and not all the necessary capabilities are
available in a single app. We created a web application that includes some fundamental
to sophisticated aspects of image alteration and they are totally free in consideration of
this issue.
All of the picture filters and other features were created utilising various image
processing theories and methods such as Intensity Transformation, Convolution,
Clustering, Masking, and so on. We used streamlit, a free, open-source, all-python
framework that enables data scientists to quickly build data and machine learning web
apps

#          All of the picture filters and other features were created utilising various image processing theories and methods such as Intensity Transformation, Convolution, Clustering, Masking, and so on.For each of these modules, separate Python scripts were written.
#           Finally, we used streamlit, an open-source Python framework for developing  web applications,
#            to merge these several scripts.
